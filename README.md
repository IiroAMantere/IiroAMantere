## Hello reader!

### Welcome to my Github profile. I'm Iiro. I study at Lahti university of applied sciences and I'm doing my best to learn. 
I have no previous coding experience so I find this difficult. I'd like to dedicate more time to learning all these new and exciting subjects that I'm being taught but my time is dripping elsewhere.
I am a bachelor of business administration by my previous eductaion so I have that salesman-like way of thinking.
My time is spent with my family and work. I have 2 lively children and a lovely fiancé. I work at warehouse nearby. My "commute" takes about a minute or two by car so it could be worse. 

Thank you for taking your time to read my introduction. Have a pleasant day :)
