## Hello reader!

### Welcome to my Github profile. I'm Iiro. I study at Lahti university of applied sciences and I'm doing my best to learn. 
I have no previous coding experience so I find this difficult. I'd like to dedicate more time to learning all these new and exciting subjects that I'm being taught but my time is dripping elsewhere.
I am a bachelor of business administration by my previous eductaion so I have that salesman-like way of thinking.
My time is spent with my family and work. I have 2 lively children and a **lovely** fiancÃ©. I work at warehouse nearby. My "commute" takes about a minute or two by car so it could be worse. I work both morning and evening shifts but
my boss has so far been very understanding and more than fair regarding me starting school. I'm lucky in many ways. :)

Thank you for taking your time to read my introduction. Have a pleasant day :)

# From this point on this is a practice file. :)
